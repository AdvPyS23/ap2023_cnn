Fashion-MNIST Classification

Building a CNN classifier in Pytorch

#### Data Preprocessing (April 30th)
* Data Loading
* Create tensors, normalize (mean 0, sd 0.5)
* Create DataLoaders (think about batch size)
* Visualize

see: [Pytorch tutorial](https://github.com/pytorch/tutorials/blob/main/beginner_source/basics/data_tutorial.py)

Expected result: Dataset and Dataloader objects

#### Model building (May 7th)
* Define the model architecture and forward pass
* Backpropagation (with autograd in Pytorch)

#### Model training & Optimization (First run by May 14th)
* Define hyperparameters
* Define training and test loops
* Save model weights 

#### Performance measures/Visualization (by end of May)
loss/accuracy curves, ROC curve?

#### Past course time (June and onwards):
Accuracy measures by class
Confusion matrix
Implement cross-validation
ROC curves
