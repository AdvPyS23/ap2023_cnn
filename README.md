# Welcome!
This project is being conducted as part of the **Advanced Python (FS2023)** course at the University of Bern. It aims at building a multi-class classifier for clothing images from the [Fashion-MNIST dataset](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist) as a convolutional neural network
as classifier architecture using the PyTorch framework. Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando article photos, with 60,000 examples in the training set and 10,000 examples in the test set. Each sample is a 28x28 grayscale image with a label from one of ten classes.
The classes are the following:

* 0: T-shirt/top
* 1: Trouser
* 2: Pullover
* 3: Dress
* 4: Coat
* 5: Sandal
* 6: Shirt
* 7: Sneaker
* 8: Bag
* 9: Ankle boot

### Defining Training and Test Data
The dataset already has a well-defined train and test dataset that we can use.
Further split the training data set into a validation set and a train set to estimate the performance for a given training run.

### Estimating the performance of the model

### Developing a baseline model

### Define Baseline Convolutional Neural Network Model

### Evaluate the Model

### Optimization Methods


To come later: information for users (how do I run this?) + Information on performance
