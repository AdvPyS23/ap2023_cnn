# Welcome!
This project is being conducted as part of the **Advanced Python (FS2023)** course at the University of Bern. It aims at building a multi-class classifier for clothing images from the [Fashion-MNIST dataset](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist) as a convolutional neural network
as classifier architecture using the PyTorch framework. Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando article photos, with 60,000 examples in the training set and 10,000 examples in the test set. Each sample is a 28x28 grayscale image with a label from one of ten classes.
The classes are the following:

* 0: T-shirt/top
* 1: Trouser
* 2: Pullover
* 3: Dress
* 4: Coat
* 5: Sandal
* 6: Shirt
* 7: Sneaker
* 8: Bag
* 9: Ankle boot

The project's general workflow consists of training, testing, and optimising the model, as well as describing and visualising its performance.
For further details on the different steps of the project please see the [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) file.


Information for users, such as how to run and use the model and the overall performance, will follow later on.
